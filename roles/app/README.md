App Role
=========

This role is repsonsible for uploading a tarball of a static HTML to the server and unzip it.

Requirements
------------

To gracefully run this role, a .tar.gz archive must be placed under the files/ directory and when unziping it, a .html file must be available.

In my opinion this fits as requirement and dependency so I'll write it on both.

Role Variables
